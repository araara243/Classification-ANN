# Balance Scale Classification Model utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to classify the balance state of a scale based on weight and distance attributes. The project leveraged machine learning techniques to analyze and improve model accuracy through various optimizers, activation functions, and hyperparameter tuning. Using the Balance Scale Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we experimented with different optimizers, including Adam, Adamax, SGD, and Nadam, and found that the Adam optimizer achieved the highest accuracy at 97.6%. This project highlights the practical application of deep learning in classification tasks and contributes to the understanding of cognitive development modeling.
